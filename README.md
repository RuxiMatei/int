# HOW IT WORKS
Creates POST request to OAuth 2.0 for access token based on CLIENT_ID
and CLIENT_SECRET, and uses it in the Authorization header for next POST
request for creating a new session, after which we get the link to API and
possibility to log in using BankID, as well as id for retrieving session data.
